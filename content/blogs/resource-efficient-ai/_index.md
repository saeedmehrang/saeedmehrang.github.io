The challenge of modern AI lies in scaling models without skyrocketing costs. This section explores breakthroughs in **model efficiency** that decouple performance from prohibitive resource consumption. Discover techniques that move beyond the quadratic complexity of traditional architectures to create powerful, yet practical, solutions for everything from large language models to complex computer vision tasks.
