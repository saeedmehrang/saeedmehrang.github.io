```

### Autoscaling Quick Reference

**Predictable Traffic Spikes:**
```
Cloud Scheduler → Cloud Function → Scale Up
(30 min before peak)
    ↓
Cloud Run: min-instances 0→5
Vector Search: auto-scales
    ↓
Cloud Scheduler → Cloud Function → Scale Down
(after peak hours)
```

**Unpredictable Traffic:**
- Cloud Run: `min-instances=2`, `max-instances=50`
- Vector Search: `min_replica_count=2`
- Redis: `allkeys-lru` eviction, TTL=3600s

## 2. Introduction & Problem Statement

### What Are We Building?

Modern generative AI applications—chatbots, document analysis tools, code assistants—require more than just a language model. They need:

- **Fast, reliable model serving** that scales with demand
- **Knowledge retrieval systems** for context-aware responses (RAG)
- **Data pipelines** for processing and embedding documents
- **Security measures** for PII detection and compliance
- **Observability** for monitoring model performance and costs

Building these systems on Google Cloud Platform requires understanding not just individual services, but how they work together as a cohesive architecture.

### Who Is This For?

This guide is designed for:
- **AI scientists** transitioning to full-stack data science roles
- **ML engineers** architecting production systems
- **Cloud architects** adding GenAI capabilities to existing infrastructure
- **Technical interviewers** preparing for cloud architecture discussions

### Why GCP for Generative AI?

GCP offers several advantages for GenAI applications:

1. **Vertex AI ecosystem** - Unified platform for ML lifecycle management
2. **Native LLM access** - Direct integration with Google's models (Gemini, PaLM)
3. **Purpose-built services** - Vector Search, Feature Store, Model Monitoring
4. **Flexible compute options** - From fully managed to custom containers
5. **Enterprise-grade security** - Built-in DLP, IAM, and compliance tools

---

## 3. Architectural Thinking: The Framework

### The 5-Layer Approach

Instead of thinking about individual services, organize your architecture into five functional layers:

**1. Model Serving Layer** - Where inference happens
- Hosts your models (proprietary or open-source)
- Handles prediction requests
- Manages model versions and traffic splitting

**2. API & Gateway Layer** - How users interact with your system
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Load balancing across backend services

**3. Storage & Data Layer** - Where knowledge lives
- Vector databases for semantic search
- Feature stores for real-time features
- Caches for performance optimization
- Long-term storage for training data

**4. Orchestration & Processing Layer** - How components communicate
- Event-driven workflows
- Data preprocessing pipelines
- Asynchronous task management

**5. Observability & Governance Layer** - How you monitor and control
- Metrics and alerting
- Distributed tracing
- Security and compliance

### Decomposing Requirements

When designing a GenAI system, ask these questions for each layer:

**Serving:** What models do we need? How will they scale?
**Gateway:** Who accesses the system? What are the SLAs?
**Storage:** What data do we retrieve? How fast must it be?
**Orchestration:** What workflows are required? Sync or async?
**Observability:** What metrics matter? What are the compliance needs?

### Request Flow vs Training Flow

Your architecture serves two distinct workflows:

**Inference (Request) Flow:**
```
User → Gateway → Orchestration → [Vector Search + Model] → Response
```
- Optimized for latency (milliseconds to seconds)
- Stateless and horizontally scalable
- Focuses on reliability and availability

**Training (Development) Flow:**
```
Data → Preprocessing → Training → Evaluation → Registry → Deployment
```
- Optimized for throughput (hours to days)
- Resource-intensive (GPUs/TPUs)
- Focuses on reproducibility and versioning

Most production architectures prioritize inference flow since it directly impacts user experience.

## 5. Handling Scale: Autoscaling Strategies

### Understanding the Challenge

GenAI applications have unique scaling characteristics:

- **Model inference is GPU-bound** - Can't scale infinitely like stateless web apps
- **Cold starts are expensive** - Loading models into memory takes 10-60 seconds
- **Traffic is often bursty** - Launch events, viral content, business hours
- **Costs scale linearly with compute** - Unlike traditional apps with economies of scale

### Component-Specific Strategies

#### Cloud Run (Orchestration & Custom Serving)

**Configuration parameters:**
- `min-instances`: Minimum always-on containers
- `max-instances`: Maximum concurrent containers
- `concurrency`: Requests per container

**Three strategies:**

**1. Cost-optimized (Unpredictable, low traffic):**
```
min-instances: 0
max-instances: 50
concurrency: 80
```
- Pros: Pay only for actual usage
- Cons: First requests after idle have cold starts (5-15s)

**2. Performance-optimized (Consistent traffic):**
```
min-instances: 5
max-instances: 50
concurrency: 80
```
- Pros: No cold starts, predictable latency
- Cons: Pay for idle capacity 24/7

**3. Balanced (Variable traffic with peaks):**
```
min-instances: 2
max-instances: 50
concurrency: 80
```
- Pros: Minimal cold starts, reasonable cost
- Cons: Slight delay during rapid scale-up

#### Vertex AI Vector Search

**Key parameter:** `min_replica_count`

**Strategy:**
- Set `min_replica_count ≥ 2` to keep index "warm"
- Vector Search auto-scales based on QPS
- No cold start issues with minimum replicas

**Additional optimization:**
- Send periodic health check queries to maintain warmth
- Use streaming updates if constantly adding vectors

#### Vertex AI Prediction

**Configuration:**
- `min_replica_count`: Minimum serving replicas
- `max_replica_count`: Maximum replicas
- `machine_type`: GPU/CPU type per replica

**Strategy:**
- Always keep `min_replica_count ≥ 1` (no scale-to-zero)
- Pay for capacity, not requests
- More predictable than Cloud Run, but less cost-flexible

#### Memorystore Redis

**Scaling approach:**

**First: Vertical scaling**
- Increase memory of existing instance (5GB → 300GB)
- Simpler operations, no distributed systems complexity

**Then: Eviction policies**
- Configure `allkeys-lru` eviction
- Set appropriate TTLs on cached data
- Let Redis self-manage memory automatically

**Last resort: Redis Cluster**
- Only for very high scale (TBs of data)
- Adds operational complexity
- Required when single instance insufficient

### Pre-warming for Predictable Spikes

For known traffic patterns (product launches, scheduled events):

```
Timeline:
T-30 min: Cloud Scheduler triggers scale-up
    ↓
Cloud Function updates configurations:
  - Cloud Run: min-instances 0 → 5
  - Vertex AI: min_replica_count 1 → 5
    ↓
T+0: Event starts, infrastructure ready
    ↓
T+3 hours: Event ends
    ↓
Cloud Scheduler triggers scale-down
    ↓
Cloud Function restores configurations:
  - Cloud Run: min-instances 5 → 0
  - Vertex AI: min_replica_count 5 → 1
```

**Implementation:** Cloud Scheduler → Cloud Function → GCP API calls

### Reactive Auto-scaling

For unpredictable spikes, monitor key metrics:

**Cloud Monitoring alerts:**
- Request queue depth > threshold → Scale up
- CPU utilization > 70% → Scale up
- Error rate > 5% → Investigate, possibly scale

**Response actions:**
- Trigger Cloud Functions to adjust configurations
- Send notifications to on-call engineers
- Log incidents for post-mortem analysis

---

## 6. Cost Optimization Playbook

### Understanding Cost Drivers

GenAI applications have distinct cost profiles:

1. **Model serving compute** (40-60% of total cost)
   - GPU instances are expensive ($1-5/hour per GPU)
   - Scales with traffic and model size

2. **Vector search** (15-25%)
   - Scales with index size and QPS
   - Machine type selection impacts cost significantly

3. **Data storage** (10-15%)
   - GCS for models and datasets
   - BigQuery for analytics

4. **Networking** (5-10%)
   - Egress charges for cross-region traffic
   - API calls between services

5. **Logging and monitoring** (5-10%)
   - Log ingestion and retention
   - Custom metrics

### Optimization Strategies by Component

#### Model Serving

**Strategy 1: Right-size your instances**
- Profile actual GPU utilization
- Use smallest instance that meets latency SLAs
- Consider CPU-only for smaller models

**Strategy 2: Batch prediction when possible**
- Group multiple requests for higher throughput
- Trade latency for cost (offline use cases)

**Strategy 3: Model optimization**
- Quantization (FP16, INT8) reduces memory and compute
- Distillation for smaller models with comparable performance
- Use efficient architectures (e.g., vLLM for LLMs)

**Strategy 4: Scale-to-zero for dev/staging**
- Cloud Run scales to zero automatically
- Significant savings for non-production environments

#### Vector Search

**Strategy 1: Index optimization**
- Use smaller machine types for development
- Scale machine type based on actual QPS needs
- Monitor and adjust `min_replica_count`

**Strategy 2: Approximate vs exact search**
- Use approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) for most queries
- Reserve exact search for critical use cases

**Strategy 3: Index segmentation**
- Separate indices for different use cases
- Scale independently based on traffic

#### Storage

**Strategy 1: Lifecycle policies**
- Move old data to Nearline/Coldline storage
- Delete temporary files automatically
- Archive logs after retention period

**Strategy 2: Compression**
- Compress datasets and models in GCS
- Use Parquet/Avro instead of CSV for large datasets

**Strategy 3: Query optimization**
- Partition BigQuery tables by date
- Cluster tables on frequently queried columns
- Use BigQuery slots efficiently

#### Caching

**Strategy: Aggressive caching with Redis**
- Cache vector search results (can save 50-80% of searches)
- Set appropriate TTLs based on data freshness requirements
- Monitor cache hit rates and adjust strategy

**Example savings:**
- Vector search query: $0.001
- Redis cache read: $0.00001
- 80% cache hit rate = 80% cost reduction on searches

#### Logging

**Strategy 1: Log sampling**
- Sample prediction logs (e.g., 10% in production)
- Log all errors and anomalies
- Full logging only in development

**Strategy 2: Structured logging**
- Use JSON for efficient querying
- Avoid duplicate information
- Export only necessary fields to BigQuery

**Strategy 3: Retention policies**
- Keep detailed logs for 30 days
- Aggregate metrics for longer retention
- Archive compliance logs to Cold storage

### Cost vs Performance Trade-offs

| Component | Cost-Optimized | Balanced | Performance-Optimized |
|-----------|----------------|----------|----------------------|
| **Cloud Run** | min=0, scale-to-zero | min=2, moderate always-on | min=10, pre-warmed |
| **Vector Search** | min_replicas=1, small machine | min_replicas=2, medium machine | min_replicas=5, large machine |
| **Redis** | 5GB, aggressive eviction | 20GB, moderate TTLs | 100GB, long TTLs |
| **Logging** | 10% sampling, 7-day retention | 50% sampling, 30-day retention | 100% logging, 90-day retention |
| **Typical Monthly Cost** | $500-2,000 | $2,000-8,000 | $8,000-25,000+ |
| **Suitable For** | MVP, prototypes, low traffic | Production, moderate traffic | Enterprise, high traffic |

### Monitoring Cost Efficiency

**Key metrics to track:**
- Cost per 1,000 predictions
- Cost per user session
- GPU utilization percentage
- Cache hit rate
- Average response latency vs cost

**Action triggers:**
- GPU utilization <50% → Downsize instance
- Cache hit rate <60% → Increase Redis capacity
- Cost per prediction increasing → Investigate inefficiencies

## 7. Production Best Practices

### Security & Compliance

#### PII Detection & Redaction
**Always use Cloud DLP API** for:
- Detecting sensitive information in user inputs
- Redacting PII before logging
- Compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, etc.

**Pattern:**
```
User Input → Cloud DLP (detect) → Redaction Logic → Model
Model Output → Cloud DLP (detect) → Redaction Logic → User
```

#### Authentication & Authorization
**Best practices:**
- Use Cloud IAM for service-to-service authentication
- Implement API keys or OAuth for user authentication
- Apply principle of least privilege
- Rotate credentials regularly

#### Data Encryption
**At rest:**
- Use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for sensitive data
- Enable encryption by default on all GCS buckets

**In transit:**
- Enforce HTTPS for all API endpoints
- Use Private Google Access for internal traffic

### Monitoring & Observability

#### What to Monitor

**Infrastructure metrics:**
- Instance count and utilization
- Request latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates by type
- Network throughput

**Model metrics:**
- Prediction latency
- Token usage (for LLMs)
- Model version distribution
- Drift detection alerts

**Business metrics:**
- Cost per prediction
- User satisfaction scores
- Feature usage patterns
- Conversion rates

#### Alert Strategy

**Critical alerts (immediate response):**
- Error rate >5% for >5 minutes
- p99 latency >10 seconds
- Service unavailability

**Warning alerts (investigate within hours):**
- Cost spike >50% vs baseline
- Cache hit rate drop >20%
- GPU utilization <30% (waste) or >90% (saturation)

**Info alerts (review daily/weekly):**
- Model drift detection
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Capacity planning thresholds

### Measuring Architecture Health

Once your GenAI application is running in production, how do you know if your architecture is truly well-designed? GCP provides automated tools to continuously assess your cloud stack across five key dimensions: security posture, cost efficiency, performance optimization, access management, and resource compliance. These tools generate actionable recommendations and health scores, helping you identify gaps before they become problems. Think of them as your architecture's "continuous health monitoring system."

| **Tool/Service** | **What It Measures** | **Use Case** | **Automation Level** |
|------------------|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Security Command Center** | Security posture, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations | Identifies security risks across all GCP resources | ✅ Fully automated scanning |
| **Recommender** | Cost optimization, performance, security improvements | Suggests rightsizing, idle resources, best practices | ✅ Automated recommendations |
| **Policy Intelligence** | IAM policies, access patterns, least privilege violations | Ensures proper access controls and permissions | ✅ Automated policy analysis |
| **Cloud Asset Inventory** | Resource compliance, organizational policies | Tracks all resources and checks policy compliance | ✅ Automated inventory + compliance |
| **Architecture Framework Assessment** | Operational excellence, reliability, performance, cost, security | Comprehensive well-architected review (manual questionnaire) | ⚠️ Manual but structured |

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

#### Architecture Anti-patterns

**1. Over-engineering for scale**
- Don't start with GKE if Cloud Run suffices
- Avoid distributed systems complexity until necessary
- Start simple, scale when needed

**2. Under-investing in monitoring**
- Can't optimize what you don't measure
- Set up monitoring before scaling issues arise
- Include cost monitoring from day one

**3. Ignoring cold starts**
- Cold starts destroy user experience
- Always configure min-instances for production
- Pre-warm before known traffic spikes

**4. Insufficient caching**
- Vector searches are expensive
- Many queries are repetitive
- Cache aggressively with appropriate TTLs

**5. Logging everything**
- Full prediction logging is expensive
- Use sampling in production
- Focus on errors and anomalies

#### Operational Pitfalls

**1. No rollback strategy**
- Always deploy with traffic splitting
- Keep previous model versions available
- Test rollback procedures regularly

**2. Lack of reproducibility**
- Version all model artifacts
- Track training data and hyperparameters
- Use Vertex AI Model Registry

**3. Manual configuration management**
- Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Cloud Deployment Manager)

- Automate deployments

**4. Ignoring model drift**
- Set up Vertex AI Model Monitoring
- Define acceptable performance ranges
- Establish retraining triggers

**5. Poor error handling**

- Log failures for analysis

### Testing Strategy

**Unit tests:**
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Validate input/output contracts

**Integration tests:**
- Test service interactions
- Validate end-to-end request flows
- Use staging environment

**Load tests:**
- Simulate expected peak traffic
- Test autoscaling behavior

- **Vertex AI Vector Search** for document retrieval (managed, scales automatically)
- **Memorystore Redis** (small instance, 5GB) for caching frequent queries
- **Cloud DLP API** for PII detection (purpose-built, 150+ detectors)
- **Cloud Logging + BigQuery** for logging (real-time + analytics)

**Configuration:**
- Cloud Run: `min-instances=0` (low traffic, cost-sensitive)
- Vector Search: `min_replica_count=2` (keep warm, but small)
- Redis: `allkeys-lru` eviction, TTL=3600s

**Why not Vertex AI Prediction?** The model is open-source (Llama 3), and traffic is too low to justify the always-on cost of managed endpoints.

### Scenario 2: Autoscaling Strategy
**Question:** Your GenAI application experiences:
- Normal traffic: 100 requests/hour
- Daily spike: 2,000 requests/hour (9-11 AM)
- Monthly product launches: 10,000 requests/hour (date known in advance)

How would you configure autoscaling?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Hybrid strategy:**

**For daily predictable spikes (9-11 AM):**
- Cloud Scheduler at 8:45 AM: Scale up
  - Cloud Run: `min-instances=2` (from 0 or 1)
  - Keep Vector Search at `min_replica_count=2` (already handles this)
- Cloud Scheduler at 11:15 AM: Scale down
  - Cloud Run: `min-instances=1` (maintain some warmth for baseline)

**For monthly product launches:**
- Manual or scheduled pre-warming 30 minutes before
  - Cloud Run: `min-instances=10`
  - Vector Search: Consider temporarily increasing to `min_replica_count=5`
- Monitor real-time during launch
- Scale down manually after launch concludes

**Baseline configuration:**
- Cloud Run: `min-instances=1`, `max-instances=50`
- Vector Search: `min_replica_count=2`
- Redis: 20GB instance (handle peak without evicting hot data)

**Key insight:** Use automation for daily patterns, manual intervention for rare high-stakes events where you want full control.
</details>

### Scenario 3: Cost Optimization
**Question:** Your architecture costs $15,000/month:
- Cloud Run serving: $8,000 (GPU instances)
- Vector Search: $4,000
- Redis: $1,500
- Logging: $1,500

How would you reduce costs by 40% without significantly impacting performance?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Target: $9,000/month ($6,000 savings)**

**Optimization plan:**

**1. Cloud Run serving ($8,000 → $4,500, save $3,500):**
- Implement aggressive caching (reduce queries by 60%)
- Model quantization (FP16 → INT8, smaller GPU needed)
- Reduce `min-instances` during off-peak hours (nights/weekends)
- Right-size GPU instances based on actual utilization metrics

**2. Vector Search ($4,000 → $2,500, save $1,500):**
- Reduce `min_replica_count` from 3 to 2
- Downsize machine type (analyze actual QPS requirements)
- Cache top 20% of queries (covers 80% of traffic)

**3. Redis ($1,500 → $1,200, save $300):**
- Analyze cache hit rates and optimize eviction policy
- Slightly more aggressive TTLs (reduce from 1 hour to 45 min)

**4. Logging ($1,500 → $800, save $700):**
- Implement 20% sampling for prediction logs (from 100%)
- Reduce BigQuery retention from 90 to 30 days
- Export less-used logs to GCS Coldline

**Total savings: $6,000/month (40% reduction)**

**Performance impact:**
- Latency increase: ~5-10% (due to caching misses)
- Availability: No change (still redundant)
- Cold starts: Slightly more during scale-up

**Key insight:** Most cost savings come from caching (reduces actual model invocations) and right-sizing compute (many deployments are over-provisioned).
</details>

### Scenario 4: Architecture Decision
**Question:** When should you use Cloud Run instead of Vertex AI Prediction for serving a generative AI model?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Use Cloud Run when:**

1. **Open-source models** (Llama, Mistral, Falcon)
   - Vertex AI Prediction primarily optimized for Google/proprietary models
   - vLLM on Cloud Run offers better performance for OSS LLMs

2. **Custom preprocessing/postprocessing**
   - Need complex business logic before/after inference
   - Multi-stage pipelines in single container

3. **Cost optimization required**
   - Traffic is sporadic (scale-to-zero capability)
   - Can't justify always-on endpoint costs

4. **Custom serving frameworks**
   - Want to use specific inference servers (vLLM, TGI, TensorRT)
   - Need cutting-edge optimizations not available in managed service

5. **Full infrastructure control**
   - Custom networking requirements
   - Specific container configurations
   - Advanced logging/monitoring integration

**Use Vertex AI Prediction when:**

1. **Google's foundation models** (Gemini, PaLM)
   - Native integration and optimization
   - Simpler API access

2. **Managed infrastructure preferred**
   - Team lacks DevOps expertise
   - Want built-in MLOps features

3. **Enterprise SLAs required**
   - Need guaranteed uptime
   - Vendor support essential

4. **A/B testing and traffic splitting**
   - Built-in canary deployments
   - Easy model version management

5. **Integrated with Vertex AI training**
   - Seamless deployment from training jobs
   - Model registry integration

**Hybrid approach (common in production):**
- Cloud Run for orchestration
- Vertex AI Prediction for Google models
- Cloud Run + vLLM for custom models
</details>

### Scenario 5: Debugging Performance
**Question:** Your RAG application has high latency (p95 = 8 seconds). Users complain it's too slow. The flow is:
```
Cloud Run → Vector Search → Cloud Run + vLLM → Cloud DLP → Response
```

How would you diagnose and fix the bottleneck?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Diagnosis approach using Cloud Trace:**

**Step 1: Add distributed tracing**
- Enable Cloud Trace across all services
- Instrument each service call
- Identify which component takes longest

**Likely findings (typical latency breakdown):**

```
Total: 8000ms
├─ Cloud Run orchestration: 50ms
├─ Vector Search: 800ms  ⚠️
├─ Cloud Run (vLLM): 6500ms  ⚠️⚠️
├─ Cloud DLP: 500ms
└─ Network overhead: 150ms
```

**Optimization strategies:**

**For Vector Search (800ms):**
- **Add Redis caching** (reduce to ~50ms for cache hits)
- Increase `min_replica_count` (index might be cold)
- Optimize query (reduce number of results retrieved)
- Check if index needs rebuilding (fragmentation)

**For vLLM inference (6500ms) - BIGGEST BOTTLENECK:**
- **Check GPU utilization** (might be under-powered)
  - If <50%: Issue is software, not hardware
  - If >90%: Need larger GPU or batching
- **Enable KV caching** in vLLM (reduces repeat token computation)
- **Reduce max_tokens** if generating too much text
- **Implement streaming responses** (perceived latency improvement)
- **Check for cold starts** (increase min-instances)
- **Consider model quantization** (INT8 is 2-3x faster)

**For Cloud DLP (500ms):**
- Only scan response text, not entire context
- Use custom detectors (faster than all 150+ types)
- Consider async processing for non-critical checks

**Expected results after optimization:**
```
Total: 2500ms (69% improvement)
├─ Cloud Run orchestration: 50ms
├─ Vector Search (cached): 50ms  ✓
├─ Cloud Run (vLLM optimized): 2000ms  ✓
├─ Cloud DLP (scoped): 300ms  ✓
└─ Network overhead: 100ms
```

**Key insight:** Always measure before optimizing. Use Cloud Trace to find the actual bottleneck—don't assume!

### Scenario 6: Security & Compliance
**Question:** Your GenAI chatbot will handle healthcare data (HIPAA compliance required). What architectural considerations must you address?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**HIPAA compliance requirements for GCP architecture:**

**1. Data Encryption**
- **At rest:** Use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for:
  - GCS buckets (model artifacts, documents)
  - BigQuery datasets (logs, analytics)
  - Memorystore Redis (conversation cache)
- **In transit:** Enforce HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ for all endpoints

**2. PII/PHI Protection**
- **Always use Cloud DLP API** to:
  - Detect PHI in user inputs before processing
  - Redact PHI before logging
  - Mask PHI in model responses if necessary
- Configure for healthcare-specific info types:
  - Medical record numbers
  - Medication names
  - ICD codes
  - Provider identifiers

**3. Access Controls**
- Implement **principle of least privilege** with IAM
- Use **VPC Service Controls** to create security perimeter
- Enable **Private Google Access** (no public internet)
- Implement **Cloud Armor** for DDoS protection

**4. Audit Logging**
- Enable **Admin Activity logs** (who did what)
- Enable **Data Access logs** (who accessed what data)
- Export logs to **immutable storage** (GCS with retention policy)
- Set up **log-based metrics** for compliance monitoring

**5. Network Isolation**
- Deploy services in **VPC** (not public internet)
- Use **Private Service Connect** for Google APIs
- Implement **firewall rules** restricting traffic
- Consider **shared VPC** for multi-project setup

**6. Data Residency**
- Choose **specific regions** for data storage (e.g., us-central1)
- Ensure Vector Search index in same region
- Configure **BigQuery** with specific location

**7. Business Associate Agreement (BAA)**
- Sign **Google Cloud BAA** (required for HIPAA)
- Document architecture in **compliance documentation**
- Regular **security assessments** and audits

**Architecture modifications:**

```
User (HTTPS only)
    ↓
[Cloud Armor] ← DDoS protection
    ↓
[HTTPS Load Balancer] ← TLS termination
    ↓
[VPC Network] ← Private communication
    ↓
[Cloud Run] ← Orchestration in VPC
    ↓
├─→ [Cloud DLP] ← Detect/redact PHI
├─→ [Vector Search] ← CMEK encrypted
├─→ [Cloud Run + vLLM] ← In VPC
└─→ [Audit Logs] ← Immutable trail
    ↓
[GCS with CMEK] ← Encrypted storage
[BigQuery with CMEK] ← Compliance logs
```

**Key insight:** HIPAA compliance is not just about encryption—it's about comprehensive data governance, access controls, and audit trails throughout the entire architecture.

## 10. Final Thoughts

You now have a comprehensive understanding of GCP architecture for generative AI applications. The key to success is:

1. **Start with clear requirements** - Understand your use case before choosing services
2. **Design in layers** - Organize complexity into manageable components  
3. **Measure everything** - You can't optimize what you don't monitor
4. **Iterate and improve** - Start simple, scale as needed, optimize continuously

In Part 2 of this series, we'll get hands-on with actual implementations, starting with deploying models to production. Stay tuned!
