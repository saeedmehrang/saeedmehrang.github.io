## Introduction

If you've ever wondered how ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude generate responses so quickly, or how language models can maintain long conversations without grinding to a halt, KV-caching is a big part of the answer. This optimization technique is one of the most critical innovations that makes modern LLM inference practical.

In this post, we'll dive deep into what KV-caching is, why it's necessary, and how it's implemented in transformer-based language models.

## The Problem: Quadratic Complexity in Autoregressive Generation

### How Transformers Generate Text

Transformers generate text **autoregressively** - one token at a time. At each step, the model needs to:

1. Process the new token
2. Attend to all previous tokens in the sequence
3. Predict the next token
4. Repeat

Here's the catch: without optimization, each generation step requires reprocessing the **entire sequence** from scratch.

### The Computational Bottleneck

Let's visualize what happens without caching:

```
Step 1: Process [token_1]
Step 2: Process [token_1, token_2]         (recomputes token_1)
Step 3: Process [token_1, token_2, token_3] (recomputes token_1, token_2)
Step 4: Process [token_1, ..., token_4]    (recomputes everything)
...
```

For a sequence of length `n`, the total number of token operations is:

```
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2 ≈ O(n²)
```

**This quadratic complexity is disastrous for long sequences.** Generating 1,000 tokens would require processing roughly 500,000 token operations - with massive redundancy since you're recomputing the same representations over and over.

## The Solution: KV-Caching

### Core Insight

The key observation is that in the attention mechanism, the **Keys (K)** and **Values (V)** for previous tokens never change once computed. Only the **Query (Q)** for the new token is fresh.

Recall the attention formula:

```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k) × V
```

Where:
- **Q (Query)**: "What am I looking for?" - only needed for the current token
- **K (Keys)**: "What do I offer?" - can be cached for all past tokens
- **V (Values)**: "What information do I provide?" - can be cached for all past tokens

### How KV-Caching Works

Instead of recomputing K and V for all tokens at each step, we:

1. **Compute** K and V for the new token only
2. **Retrieve** cached K and V from all previous tokens
3. **Concatenate** new K, V with cached K, V
4. **Compute** attention using the new Q against all K
5. **Update** the cache with the new K, V for next iteration

This reduces complexity from **O(n²) to O(n)** - a massive improvement!

## Interactive Visualization

To better understand how KV-caching works in practice, I've created an interactive visualization that shows the generation process step-by-step. Click "Start Prefill Phase" to see how the model first processes the entire prompt and populates the initial cache. Then watch as the model generates tokens one at a time, with the cache growing incrementally at each step.

{{< include-html "static/interactive/kv-cache-viz.html" >}}

The visualization clearly demonstrates the two-phase nature of KV-cached generation: the **prefill phase** where we process all prompt tokens at once, and the **generation phase** where we process one token at a time while reusing cached computations.


## Implementation Details

### Cache Structure

The cache stores tensors for each layer in the model:

```python
kv_cache = {
    layer_idx: {
        'keys': Tensor[batch, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim],
        'values': Tensor[batch, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim]
    }
}
```

### Two-Phase Generation

Modern LLM inference typically has two distinct phases:

#### 1. Prefill Phase

Process the entire prompt at once to populate the initial cache:

```python
# Process all prompt tokens together
logits, kv_caches = model(prompt_tokens, use_cache=True)

# Cache now contains K, V for all prompt tokens
# Shape: [batch, num_heads, prompt_length, head_dim]
```

This phase is still O(n²) for the prompt, but it only happens once.

#### 2. Generation Phase

Generate tokens one at a time, growing the cache incrementally:

```python
for step in range(max_new_tokens):
    # Only process the latest token
    logits, kv_caches = model(
        current_token,           # Single token
        kv_caches=kv_caches,     # Reuse cache
        use_cache=True,
        position_offset=position
    )
    
    # Cache automatically grows
    # New shape: [batch, num_heads, position+1, head_dim]
    
    next_token = sample(logits)
    position += 1
```

Each generation step is now O(n) instead of O(n²).

### Memory Considerations

While KV-caching dramatically speeds up generation, it comes with memory costs:

**Memory per token** = `2 × d_model × sizeof(dtype)`

For example, with:
- `d_model = 12,288` (GPT-3 scale)
- `dtype = float16` (2 bytes)

Each token adds `~49 KB` to the cache **per layer**. For a model with 96 layers and a 10,000 token sequence, that's nearly **50 GB** of cache!

This is why:
- Batch sizes are limited during inference
- Long context windows are expensive
- Advanced techniques like PagedAttention are needed

## Practical Impact

### Performance Gains

For typical generation scenarios, KV-caching provides:

- **10-100x speedup** depending on sequence length
- Longer sequences see bigger gains
- Essential for real-time applications like chatbots

### Trade-offs

**Advantages:**
- Massive speed improvements
- Linear scaling with sequence length
- Enables practical long-form generation

**Disadvantages:**
- Significant memory overhead
- Reduces maximum batch size
- Requires careful memory management
- Cache must be cleared between unrelated requests

## Advanced Optimizations

Modern systems build on KV-caching with additional techniques:

### PagedAttention (vLLM)

Treats KV-cache like virtual memory:
- Splits cache into fixed-size "pages"
- Allows non-contiguous memory allocation
- Enables cache sharing across requests
- Dramatically improves memory efficiency

### Multi-Query Attention (MQA)

Reduces cache size by sharing K, V across all attention heads:
- Only one K, V per layer instead of per head
- Reduces cache size by factor of `num_heads`
- Slight quality trade-off
